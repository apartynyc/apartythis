            <p>For the debut of our UK/EU-based Nova Acoustics line array we co-organised a free party on the lush shores of the river Tagus - not far from Lisbon, Portugal. We couldn't have been happier with the sound quality and overall one of the best parties *a party's* team has had the privilege of attending, let alone being part of.</p>
            <p>The dancefloor had a dense, club-like yet very clear sound which subtly tapered to a pleasantly ambient yet crystal-clear and balanced sound on the sandy floodbanks. The line array mains and sub array exhibited excellent dispersion control from their line length and hornloading techniques - this resulted in even tonality and levels on the dancefloor and very little noise bleed in undesired areas, critical for an event requiring this level of discretion.</p>
            <p>The absurd headroom of our 24 channels of amps and DSP, with combined 102,960W of power resulted in extremely clean, distortion-free sound. Nova's attention to phase coherence in their top design is seen in very few line arrays, resulting in exceptional transient response and clarity.</p>
            <p>TL;DR - It Sounds Tight As Fuck.</p>
